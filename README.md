## Hi there, I'm Zaid and it's nice that you're here 👋

<!--
**Za-Qar/Za-Qar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

A multidisciplinary full stack developer and software designer with experience working in agile tech teams and remotely to deliver real-world creative solutions. With a background in visual communication design, my skill set extends to digital, graphic and web design. I get geeky about creative things, will jump on a chance to hike, and in another life, I would travel the solar system starting with Saturn and its majestic rings. I am inspired by Mike from Creative Mints and his modern clean style.
